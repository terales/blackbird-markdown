# Markdown App

<!-- begin docs -->

This is an unofficial Blackbird.io app for converting Markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`) to and from XLIFF.

## Connecting

This app does not require any special connection settings.

## Actions

This combination of actions allows you to convert any Markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`) to XLIFF and back. Use it in combination with other Blackbird apps that take or modify XLIFF files.

- **Convert Markdown to XLIFF** takes Markdown file and converts it to an XLIFF file.
- **Convert XLIFF to Markdown** takes a (modified) XLIFF file and an original Markdown file; it returns the translated Markdown file.
